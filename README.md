# C Programming Assignments

This repository contains the assignments I have done while learning **C Programming** from *MySirg Education Private Limited*.  
The course was taught by **Saurabh Shukla Sir**.  

I completed all the assignments given in the course and uploaded them here so that I can keep track of my progress and also help others who are learning.  

##  What’s inside?
- Basic programs in C (printing, variables, operators)  
- Conditional statements (if-else, switch case)  
- Loops (for, while, do-while)  
- Functions (user-defined and built-in)  
- Arrays (1D and 2D)  
- Strings in C  
- Pointers  
- Structures  
- File handling (basic programs)  

##  Purpose
- To practice and improve my C programming skills  
- To have a collection of all my assignment solutions in one place  
- To share with others who are learning C

1. Clone this repository  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Amolraut638/C-Programming.git
